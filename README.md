hi guys) at work in a startup that I am engaged in, they gave me a new idea for practicing skills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, I created a website on react, with a visualization of the video stream and the recognized emotion.
I trained the classifier (resnet34) to predict one of 7 emotions.

After that, I rented a server, launched a project on it, configured nginx and connected ssl so that the site had a domain name and a secure connection.

As soon as I find the time, I will train the detector to get only the area with the face on the episode.
