hi guys) at work in a startup that I am engaged in, they gave me a new idea for practicing skills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, I am writing a website on react, which will have a window with a video and visualization of your recognized emotion.

We need to train the detector to highlight the area with the face on the episode, then train the classifier (we will have resnet34), 
which will predict one of the 7 emotions.

After that, we will put the project on hosting and you will be able to test it)
(by the way https://ai-project-21.ru)
